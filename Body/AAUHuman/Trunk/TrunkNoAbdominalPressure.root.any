This model will include most muscles of the lumbar part. For a detailed description and for the references see:

You should be aware of the following facts:
- The model is not evaluated. We are planning on doing some experiments in the beginning of next year. This of course doesn't mean that you couldn't use it, but maybe a sort of validation is needed for your own purpose.
- The muscles do not include the force-length-velocity relations (i.e. we use the socalled simple muscle model). The only input parameter in the muscle model is the cross-sectional area multiplied by a factor. At the moment we use a specific muscle tension of 65 N/cm2. Daggfeldt and Thorstensson (J.Biomech. 2003, 36: 815-825) didn't include the force-length-velocity relations either.
- In the paper we wrote that we include ligaments, but we have to exclude those in the first version of the spine model, because we do not have the necessary mechanical properties. This is however not a problem, because it has been shown that the torque production from ligaments might not be very important (Cholewicki and McGill, J.Biomech. 1992, 25: 17-28).
