/** A detailed model of the cervical spine.

TrunkLumbarNoMusclesNeck.root.any is the root file for an isolated cervical spine model with muscles.

Most of the data for this model is taken from:
van der Horst, M. J. Human head neck response in frontal, lateral and rear end impact loading - modelling and validation.
2002. Technische Universtiteit Eindhoven, Eindhoven, The Netherlands.(Ph.D. thesis)

which can be downloaded from: http://alexandria.tue.nl/extra2/200211336.pdf


Some important facts about this model
- The model is only partly evaluated. More validation is needed for your own purpose.
- The model does not include facet joints.
- The muscles do not include the force-length-velocity relations (i.e. we use the socalled simple muscle model).
  The only input parameter in the muscle model is the cross-sectional area multiplied by a factor.
- Ligaments are not included in this model, because we do not have the necessary mechanical properties.We have decided
  against including ligaments in fear that ligaments with wrong properties might give worse results than excluding
  them. When the necessary information comes available for the ligaments, it is relatively easy to include
  them in the model.


This root file contains the following include files:
"..\Trunk\SegmentsLumbar.any"  The segments of the lumbar part
"SegmentsThoraxWithoutNeck.any" The thorax segment
"SegmentsCervicalSpine.any" The segments of the cervical spine
"JointsTrunkLumbarNeck.any" The joints of the cervical spine
"MusclesCervicalSpineRight.any" The muscle definitions of the right side in the cervical spine
"MusclesCervicalSpineLeft.any" The muscle definitions of the left side in the cervical spine
"MuscleParametersCervicalSpineSimpleRight.any" The muscle parameters of the right side in the cervical spine
"MuscleParametersCervicalSpineSimpleLeft.any" The muscle parameters of the left side in the cervical spine
