Application Examples
====================

In the repository, you can find musculoskeletal applications from a wide area of
interests. These models are from various AnyBody users, and all demonstrate
features from the AnyBody Modeling System. 

.. note:: All examples are powerful computational models where variables of interest have been
      biomechanically checked to make sense. However, when modifying or using
      models for other purposes results may occur that cannot be interpreted by
      anatomical or physiological considerations.
