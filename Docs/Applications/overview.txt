Application examples
=============================

In the repository, you can find musculoskeletal applications from a wide area of
interests. These models are from various AnyBody users, and all demonstrate
features from the AnyBody Modeling System. 

.. note:: All examples are powerful computational models where variables of interest have been
      biomechanically checked to make sense. However, when modifying or using
      models for other purposes results may occur that cannot be interpreted by
      anatomical or physiological considerations.


Motion Caputure and gait analysis
----------------------------------

All MoCap examples uses the base *AnyMoCap* model, which is a new framework for 
making MoCap models in the AMMR.

- **Simple Lower extremity model** 
    Example of lower body MoCap model using the Plug-in-Gait marker protocol,
    and walking on three typ4 force platforms. The model is fairly simple and a
    good starting point for new users. If you plan to have many trials/subjects,
    take a look at 

- **Simple Full body model**
    Example of full body MoCap model using the Plug-in-Gait marker protocol, and
    walking on three typ4 force platforms. The model is fairly simple and a good
    starting point for new users. If you plan to have many trials/subjects, take
    a look at 

- **Simple GRF prediction model**
    Example of full body MoCap mocdel using the Plug-in-Gait marker protocol but
    without force plates. The external forces are predicted using the GRF
    algorithms. 

- **Multi trial MoCap model**
    Example of MoCap model structured for analysing data from multiple trials
    and subjects. The subject antropometry is scaled/optimized from a single
    static (or dynamic) referece. The model is organized so each trial has its
    own mainfile. A structure makes it much easier to work with large datasets.
    This is the best starting point for analysing bigger MoCap experiments. 

- **Inertial MoCap example**
    Example of a MoCap mdoel using data from a inertial motional caputure suit.
    The model uses a BVH file with data from an Xsens suit. The ground reaction
    forces are predicted using the GRF prediction algorithm. 
    
- **Special AnyMocap features**
    A collection of small models that show-off special features of the
    *AnyMocap* framework. This includes offset to forceplates, individual cutoff
    frequencies for markers,  normalization with respect to gait cycle events,
    using time-varying weight for markers, plus more. 


Orthopedics and rehab

Other examples
--------------------

- **Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) Model (Beta):**
      Demo example of a total knee replacement using contact forces on the implant
      and force-dependent kinematics (FDK).

- **John Wu finger model (Beta):**
      Model from a finger with muscles only, there is no attachment to the rest of
      the body, not even the hand. This model was kindly provided by John Wu.

-  **Cow:(beta)** 
      Model of a cows leg. Driven by a motion caputure and with measured ground reaction forces.
