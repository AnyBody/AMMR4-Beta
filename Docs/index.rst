Welcome to the AMMR documentation!
=======================================

The AnyBody Model Repository (AMMR), is an open library of

System`_.

   *The AnyBody Model Repository is a unique open collection of human body parts*.

The AnyBody Managed Model Repository consists of two parts:

* 
    Body Models (put link): The human body models which can be 
    customized and scaled to build a specific musculoskeletal model;
    
* 
    Application examples (put link): in which the body models are
    utilized in specific applications (from common daily activities,
    like pushing the acceleration or brake pedals of a car, to workplace
    specific scenarios).
     

The models are developed in research projects at academic institutions or by
AnyBody Technology in collaboration with academic institutions. The models are
maintained by AnyBody Technology who ensure that various body part models can
be used together as full body, scalable musculosketal model.
