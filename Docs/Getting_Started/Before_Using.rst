Before Using the AMMR
=====================

Before you start using AMMR you might want to take a look
into versioning tools. Since you're here, let us begin.

Versioning control tools are usually used in software
development but not only, to keep track of changes and
for backup. There are situations in which the models might become
overwhelming complex, and changes will occur all around the place
during development. These changes may generate bugs and keep your
model off until you fix them. Using a versioning tool you'll be
able to have a working version of your model while you generate
a new one. You can then merge your changes with your main model
once you obtain a stable version.
