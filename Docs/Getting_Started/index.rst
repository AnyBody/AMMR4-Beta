===========================

.. rubric:: AMMR Intallation


The newest version of the *AnyBody Model Repository* (AMMR) comes bundled with the 
`AnyBody Modelling System`_. This means that when you install AnyBody, the AMMR
version available at the time of its release will be installed together with it
inside the installation folder. (Morten)

.. note:: You might need however to use the newest AMMR Files instead,
    which are setting up the AMMR with the latest Body Models and Application
    scenarios.
    You can find out how to get and install the latest AMMR here:

.. rubric:: Before using AMMR


Before editing or create models, it is great to know how
to track changes made along the development of your models. 
Modelling with AnyBody makes use of AnyScript (add link),
therefore version control software can be used to store the models safely in a remote
repository for keeping them safe or for sharing them easily.

.. note:: If want to know more about versioning software and how to set them up,

include the Human Model (add photo). Regardless of complexity, all models share a
common AnyScript structure used to set them up. To get a detailed insight into
