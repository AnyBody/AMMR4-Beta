AMMR documentation
#############################


This the folder where the final AMMR documentation will be placed. This folder
is empty since you are working with the development version of the AMMR
repository. 

You can build the AMMR documentation your-self, which will fill this folder. 

To build the AMMR documentation you first need to install the right tools. First
ensure you have the `Anaconda Python distribution
<https://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_ installed. 

Then run the following commands to install the necessary packages. 

.. code-block:: bat

    c:\> conda install -c conda-forge sphinx cloud_sptheme pygments_anyscript matplotlib pillow

Once the packages are installed run this command in the ``ammr\doc`` subfolder to build the AMMR . 

.. code-block:: bat

    c:\path\to\ammr\doc > make html

Once complete open the file: ``ammr/Documentation/index.html`` in a browser to view 
the result.
