//# Note. Since these tests include main files from other
//# applications they alter the ANYBODY_PATH_MAINFILEDIR and 
//# ANYBODY_PATH_MAINFILE preprocessor flags. 
//#
//# If these flags are important to the model they must be mocked by the
//# test framework. This can be done by adding the following test directives. 
//# path = {'ANYBODY_PATH_MAINFILEDIR':'../../Application/Examples/CrossTrainer',
//#         'ANYBODY_PATH_MAINFILE':'../../Application/Examples/CrossTrainer/CrossTrainer.main.any' }
