This model uses the full body model, i.e. most of the body parts available
in the AAUHuman part of the Body directory. The model is grounded at the
pelvis and the posture if the model is controlled through a mannequin.any 
file by means of joint angles.

This application is a really good starting point for new applications 
involving the entire body. It is quite exactly like the FreePosture model
with the exception that static or constant velocity joint angles are 
replaced by interpolated drivers where the user can modify the interpolation
points very easily.
