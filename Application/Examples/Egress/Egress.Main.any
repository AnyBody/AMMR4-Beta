/** -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
This model deals with the problem of getting out of a car - so called Egress.
For many elderly people, the task of getting up from a low car seat in a
situation where limited space is available can be quite strenous.

This model simulates an egress movement from where the occupant has just left
the support of the seat and until he or she is standing up.

The support points are:
- The left foot on the road outside the car
- The right foot on the floor inside the car
- The right hand holding on to a handle on the window frame

The question the model must answer is:
- What is the best position of the handle along the window frame?

The model investigates the muscular effort for varying positions of 
the window frame handle as it is moved from a low position to
a high position.

Notice that the model is not driven by actual motion capture data. Most
of the kinematics of the model is determined by the contact to the support
points. Additionally the pelvis is driven along an interpolated spline 
curve.*/
