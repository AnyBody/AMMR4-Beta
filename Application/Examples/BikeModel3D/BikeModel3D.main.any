/** --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a bicyling model. It illustrates several important topics in model 
construction:
- Block building techniques
- Include files
- Structuring of models using directories
- Modeling of an environment as a mechanism, in this case the bicycle

The human model is included as a block from the Body (BodyRepository) directory. 

The model of the bike including bike frame, crank, wheels, definition of 
crank moment etc. can be found in the include file "BikeFrameAndWheels.any".

The connections between the "human model" and the bicycle are defined in 
BikeLegConnection.any.
