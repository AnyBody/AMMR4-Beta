/** ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This mandible model is based on a CT scan from a 30 year old male.

You can read more about this model and its validation in the following article:
de Zee, M., M. Dalstra, P.M. Cattaneo, J. Rasmussen, P. Svensson, and B. Melsen. Validation of a
musculo-skeletal model of the mandible and its application to mandibular distraction osteogenesis.
J.Biomech. 40: 1192-1201, 2007.

Be aware that the model is work in progress:
- The mandibular fossa is modelled as a planar constraint without curvature.

The kinematic data for the chewing case is based on measurements. However, the chewing force
is simulated and might differ a lot from reality. It is only meant as a demonstration.

The work is supported by the Villum Kann Rasmussen Foundation. And I would like to acknowledge my co-workers:
Paolo M. Catteneo, Michel Dalstra, John Rasmussen, Birte Melsen, Peter Svensson

The work was performed at the Department of Orthodontics, School of Dentistry,Faculty of Health Sciences,
University of Aarhus

Do not hesitate to contact me for questions and/or suggestions.

  Calibration models and studies
  
  Together with the geometry of the model, model calibration is one
  of the most critical parts within our models. In theory it is not necessary
  to calibrate the model provided that your muscle data and geometry are exactly correct,
  which is rarely the case.
  With model calibration we mean fine-tuning of the muscle properties in such
  a way that each individual muscle works in the right part of their force-length
  relationship complying as much as possible with existing literature. From the literature
  information is gathered about joint positions where muscle fibres of individual
  muscles have their optimal length (Note that those joint position are not
  necessarily the position where the muscle creates the largest moment). When
  these joint positions are known the tendon length in the model is modified
  keeping the rest of the muscle properties constant (maximum muscle force, muscle
  fibre length) in such a way that the fibres work at their optimal length in
  that position.
