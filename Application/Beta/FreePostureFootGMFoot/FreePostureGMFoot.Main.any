This model uses the full body model, i.e. most of the body parts available
in the AAUHuman part of the Body directory. The model is grounded at the
pelvis and the posture if the model is controlled through a mannequin.any 
file by means of joint angles.

This application uses the Glasgow-Maastricht Foot Model.
